#Real-time collaborative editor similar to Google Doc is built.

A prototype is hosted on heroku: https://mighty-lake-37832.herokuapp.com/


Updated: 

added support of UNDO/REDO.


PS:

Not all keys on keyboard have been supported, e.g. 'shift' not supported yet.

However, it's only some tedious mapping work.
