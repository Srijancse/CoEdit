A prototype is deployed on heroku: https://mighty-lake-37832.herokuapp.com/


Updated: 

added support of UNDO/REDO.


TODOs:

1. Database for different docs. Currently only one doc and the doc number is meaningless.

2. Map all the keys. E.g. 'shift' is not supported yet. However, it's only some tedious mapping work.

3. Selection transform, copy, paste, etc.
